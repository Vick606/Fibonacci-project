# Recursion Practice: Fibonacci and Merge Sort

This project is part of a refresher course powered by The Odin Project, focusing on implementing recursive algorithms in JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates two classic recursive algorithms:

1. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
2. Merge Sort

Both algorithms are implemented using recursive approaches, showcasing the power and elegance of recursion in solving complex problems.

## Features

### Fibonacci Sequence Generator
- Implements both iterative and recursive methods to generate Fibonacci sequences.
- Allows user to specify the length of the sequence.

### Merge Sort
- Implements the merge sort algorithm recursively.
- Sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependecies (npm install)
3. Build (npm run build)
4. For Fibonacci (node dist/main.js fib <number>)
5. For MergeSort (node dist/main.js merge <number1> <number2> <number3>)
Example: `node dist/main.js merge 3 2 1 13 8 5 0 1`

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've reinforced my understanding of:
- Recursive problem-solving techniques
- JavaScript array manipulation
- Modular code organization
- Command-line application development
- Webpack for bundling JavaScript applications

## Acknowledgments

This project is completed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, an open-source coding education platform.

## Future Improvements

- Add more recursive algorithms (e.g., binary search, tree traversals)
- Implement performance comparisons between recursive and iterative approaches
- Create a simple web interface for easier interaction

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
